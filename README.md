# VAE_PointNet
This repository is for a project for VCS course.

# Overview
This repository implements the PointNet architecture for the 3D object classification task on the Modelnet40 and Modelnet10 datasets. To enhance the model's performance, hyperparameter tuning is applied. Additionally, a hybrid model incorporating Variational Autoencoder (VAE) is implemented to further improve classification accuracy.
